# Project Thesis - MSc in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)

I, Yashitha Agarwal, do hereby declare that this thesis entitled Modelling the Impact of a Novel Pathogen on the Healthcare System is a bonafide record of research work done by me for the award of MSc in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) from National University of Ireland, Galway. It has not been submitted, in part or whole, to any university or institution for any degree, diploma, or other qualification.

A mathematical infectious disease SEIR model has been developed using Vensim, based on the Covid-19 data from the Netherlands. The model is available in the `Model` folder, along with the final simulation. Most of the data required for developing this model was extracted from the files in the `Data` folder. Finally, the initial values for Covid-19 were extrapolated from the research papers in the `Literature` folder.

NOTE: Vensim needs to be installed on the system, in order to be able to open and run simulations on this SEIR model.
